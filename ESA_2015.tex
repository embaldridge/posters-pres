Increasing accessibility for chronically ill/disabled scientists also improves accessibility for researchers who are unable to travel to events for other reasons (lack of funds, distance, etc.). I present recommendations to encourage ecology to become a more accessible discipline to those with chronic illnesses/disabilities, from a general perspective and on the scale of individual collaborations.\\ 

Disclosing a chronic illness or disability, whether mental or physical, is very difficult for many people, and yet it is the only way to get official support from an organization, as the default position is, in practice, a lack of support.  Additionally, without an official diagnosis, it's not possible to get accommodations officially through the university, although it takes months, and often years to get an official diagnosis with many chronic illnesses.
